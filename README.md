# Ruis-executor
a free public open source roblox executor that uses mainly js and python (still in dev)

to get started you need to download the zip of this respitory and then once its on your computer you need to extract all.

in order to set up this executor you need to run the exe file until it closes. (it will be a blank command prompt)

after that is done you right click the roblox player launcher file and click run with "RUI.exe"

to get the scripts inside of it you will need to put them inside the same directory as this one you are reading. (the files need to be in .js format)



##IMPORTANT##
If you have any problems dm me on discord Krit#3559
I will respond as soon as i can (at MOST 3 or 4 hours)
this should not flag your antivirus and your computer shouldnt think its a virus so you wont have to disable anything but if it does spam dm me until i respond and i will try to fix it. goodluck scripting and ask me anything if you need it !!
